          Itâ€™s close to impossible that a potential student or their parents are
          not internet users. In this era, taking your marketing online is the
          smartest move. By performing your educational institute marketing
          online, you can reach your target audience with great ease. Several
          schools, colleges, etc have already started using the services of
          digital marketing agencies to effectively communicate with the
          students, parents, etc and leading to a higher rate of
          enrollment.Education marketing is a type of marketing that promotes
          valuable educational content and helps institutions and individuals
          take advantage of it.It helps a person to get knowledge and improve

          For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting
          stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students
          actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
          practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop
          thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.I think the govt. is trying hard on
          this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it
          might turn out to be too late. Practical oriented curriculum for all
          subjects could also be considered.

          Let's Grow Together is an organisation whose primary purpose is the
          establishment of educational, enjoyable and illuminating environmental
          projects within schools. Much of our work is aimed at establishing
          food-growing as a centrepiece to the activities of schools. We aim to
          educate children about the value of food-growing with a view to
          bringing about environmental, health, social and financial benefits.In
          addition, our activities extend into practical garden construction and
          maintenance including work outside of schools and the time-tabled
          school day.
